Overview
This Python script is designed to track and analyze cryptocurrency whale activities by monitoring large transactions on the blockchain. It aims to identify significant market movements by examining the size and frequency of these transactions.

Features
Blockchain Transaction Retrieval: The script uses the requests library to fetch the latest unconfirmed transactions from the blockchain explorer API, allowing users to analyze real-time data.

Whale Transaction Filtering: It filters out "whale transactions" based on a specified size threshold. These are large transactions that could potentially impact the market significantly.

Transaction Analysis: The script analyzes these large transactions to identify patterns, such as frequent addresses involved in whale activities. This is done using the pandas library for efficient data handling.

Market Movement Prediction: Utilizing the TextBlob library, the script attempts to predict future market movements based on the analyzed data. It assigns a sentiment score to the addresses involved in whale transactions and predicts market trends as either 'Positive' or 'Negative'.

Error Handling and Logging: The script includes robust error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure reliability and ease of debugging.

Customizable Parameters: Users can set their own limits and thresholds for transaction size, allowing for flexible and targeted analysis.

How to Use
To use this script, simply call the track_whale_activity function with the desired limit for the number of transactions to retrieve and the threshold for what constitutes a whale transaction. The script will then perform all the steps from fetching transactions to predicting market movements.

Example Usage
python
Copy code
try:
    result = track_whale_activity(1000000, 10000000)
    print(result)
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error while tracking whale activity: {e}")

Dependencies
Python 3.x
requests for API calls
pandas for data manipulation
textblob for sentiment analysis
logging for error logging
